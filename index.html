                writer,
                digital artist, and game designer. My dream is to work in the video game industry as a narrative
                designer or script writer. On this website, you'll be able to see my many projects, and have easy access
                to

            <p style="padding-left: 1.5%;"> As someone who wants to work in the game industry, video games are pretty
                important to me. Some of my favorite video games are
                <b>Risk of Rain 2</b>, <b>Elden Ring</b>, <b>Deadlock</b>, <b>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth</b>,
                <b>Minecraft: Java Edition</b>, <b>Dark Souls 3</b>, and <b>Team Fortress 2</b>.

                myself and

                    <p id="RPG"> A silly and absurd board game for 2+ players that parodies anything and
                        everything that can be considered a role playing game-- as well as a bunch of other unrelated
                        media.
                        It's a blast to play with friends, and the ridiculous amount of content makes no session the
                        same.
                        Oh-- and you get to kill God at the end!</p>

                    <p id="RPG">
                        I designed this game in its entirety
                        while I was sick over the winter break of 2024. The original concept came to me in a fever
                        dream, and after a while's work of
                        deciphering my feverish sketches, I went right to making the game and playtesting it with my
                        friends. At the time, I had no idea what went into making a board game. I was purely riding on
                        design and a dream, which at least led to a pretty fun game to play with my friends.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="RPG">One year later (which was coincidentally the year I took a tabletop game design class in
                        college), I returned to the project
                        with a fresh perspective and new ideas and create the Green Update, for which I reworked just
                        about everything, and added a ton of new stuff (including of course the color green.)
